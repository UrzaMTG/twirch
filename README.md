# twirch
A slightly different chat tool for Twitch. Combine several chats into a single scrolling window, rather than multiple different areas to keep track of.
## How to use
Type the channels that you want to combine into the URL bar, separated by slashes (/). For example, if you want to combine Channel1 and Channel2, your twirch URL would be twirch.io/channel1/channel2
